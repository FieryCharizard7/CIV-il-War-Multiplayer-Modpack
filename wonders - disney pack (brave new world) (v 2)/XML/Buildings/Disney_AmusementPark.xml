			<Text>An amusement park is a grouping of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Amusement parks evolved from European fairs and pleasure gardens, which were created for people's recreation. The oldest amusement park in the world is Bakken, north of Copenhagen, Denmark, which opened in 1583. In the United States, world's fairs and expositions were another influence on development of the amusement park industry. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to traveling funfairs and carnivals.</Text>
