			<Text>The Square Kilometre Array is a large multi radio telescope project aimed to be operational in the early to mid-21st century. Whilst its core sites will be based in South Africa and Australia, twelve countries in total will be involved in its operation with the array planned to extend out to at least 3,000Â kilometres across the Southern Hemisphere, which would cover a total area of approximately one square kilometre. It will provide the highest resolution images in all astronomy in the hopes of solving of the greatest mysteries of the universe.</Text>

			<Text>The Universal Constructor, as known as a Molecular Assembler, is a proposed device able to arrange molecules with atomic precision not unlike a highly advanced 3D printer and could allow mass production of incredibly intricate parts on an unprecedented scale. Whilst purely conceptual and largely explored through science-fiction today, no one has yet discovered an insurmountable problem with the underlying theories.</Text>

			<Text>The Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "Star Wars", was a proposed defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. It was first publicly announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and considered a whole range of methods for intercepting ballistic missiles from orbital lasers to ground-based missile shields. The project was later deemed to be technologically and financially unfeasible and threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of power in the Cold War leading to the program being dissolved in 1993. However, the initiative led to significant advancements in missile defence systems, which are still being developed and deployed to this day.</Text>
